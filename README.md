## End_to_End_ML-IPL_Score_Prediction  machine learning project with deployment

This repository contains the complete end-to-end machine learning project.

# Clone this repo 
    1.Create one virtual environment.i haven't created,for me its worked but better to create one VE.
    2.Once you cloned this repo you need to install the needed lib if not installed in your machine.
# run the IPL Score Prediction end to end ML
    1. pkl wasnt worked for me so that i have converted model to bin file which i used my flask web application.
    2. Then you have to learn some basics of creating flask application and alse we have to learn  the folder structure as well.
    3. once you have  set up  all the requirement just run the app.py file it will redirect to webpage.


Step 1 : Install latest version of VSCODE (I have used latest version )

Step 2 : Setup the Environment ( Create new or use locally)

Step 4 : Install required library (numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seabro,scikit-learn,flask,pickle.)

Step 5 : PKL file that may be will not work in your version try to convert bin file of your model.
         ( i have converted my model to bin that was worked)

Step 6 : Before creating the flask application you should gothrough any website or youtube about 
         Creating Flask application for machine learning model

         i will share some of the link
